# Are you bored?
A Flutter app that uses the Bored Api to display suggested activities. The user can specify what kind of activity and how many participants he wants. Some activities have a linked link - if the user clicks on them, the app will open a browser with the linked web page.

## What I use in this app:
- BLoC Architecture Pattern
- Flutter packages:
    - flutter_bloc
    - http
    - url_launcher
    - google_fonts
    - sliding_up_panel
    - auto_size_text
